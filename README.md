# Adventure Bot

Adventure Bot is a project that started around 12th of September 2021 and i currently ongoing. The bot originally 
"Utilities-Xtra" was a per name a Utility bot but ended up with a rpg style system mainly where you could hunt monsters to 
earn items and levels which where used in upgrading. The whole bot was put down due to economical problems and was dead for a 
while until recent where I wanted to create "Adventure-Bot", which will fully focus on the RPG style which the original bot 
had but will be heavily modified and improoved.

As of now (18th of September 2021) the bot is currently being developed solo by [Light](https://github.com/LightBlueGamer). 
However plans are to expand the bot onto a team to increase the speed at which the initial release will come. 
Future plans are for everyone with the help of the upcoming dashboard to be able to help and develop the bot further by 
adding new items, monsters and even classes.

A lot of thanks goes to [York](https://github.com/YorkAARGH) and to the whole [Enmap](https://discord.evie.dev/) community for
a lot of help with problem solutions and ideas.
